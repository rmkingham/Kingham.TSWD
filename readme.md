# About me
Hi! My name is Rachel Kingham. I use she/her pronouns. I grew up in Fort Collins, CO and then went to Coe College in Cedar Rapids, IA where I earned a Flute Performance Degree. After that, I moved to Ann Arbor, MI where I worked at Noodles and Company, eventually becoming the General Manager of my restaurant. While there, I was working way too many hours, which meant it was time to go back to school. Here, I am a Master of Arts Management student.
