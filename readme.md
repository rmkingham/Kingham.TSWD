# Rachel's Portfolio
This is my portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU Fall 2019.

# About me
Hi! My name is Rachel Kingham. I use she/her pronouns. I grew up in Colorado and then went college in Iowa where I earned a Flute Performance Degree. After that, I moved to Michgan and managed a restaurant. While there, I was working way too many hours, which meant it was time to go back to school. Here, I am a Master of Arts Management student. After graduation, I want to be on the operations and management side of something related to entertainment and people's leisure time, though I don't know what segment of the industry I want to work in. I like to help build relationships and teams to conquer difficult tasks.  

# What I hope to Learn
I hope to learn about how I can display data in an accurate and concise manner. Too often, I see data that is boring or confusing, which means that the reader is not learning what the presenter wanted them to. I would like to learn about the tools to create the data visualizations, so that I can create my own visualizations in the future. Data is a powerful tool when used correctly, and being able to display it in a meaningful way is the first step.

# Portfolio
Here is where I will put all my data visualizations. But for now, have a picture of my dog.
