# Final Project: Third Baseman of the Decade (2010-2019)

## Part I
### Outline

In this project, I will analyze data from Major League Third Basemen over the last 10 years to determine who has been the most effective. In order to be considered, each Third Baseman will have had to qualify for year end awards (by MLB standards) for at least 5 of the 10 years. 

The major elements of my story will be the defensive analysis, offensive analysis, awards discussion, and conclusion. To assess defense, I will look at Fielding Percentage, Average Total Chances over their qualifying years, and Range Factor. To assess offense, I will look at Batting Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, and On-base Plus Slugging. This selection should satisfy both the traditionalists and the modernists by included the statistics for the Triple Crown and the modern OPS. In addition to that, I will use the data from the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year, Rawlings Gold and Platinum Gloves, Hank Aaron, and Silver Slugger awards to strengthen my case. 

I plan to start with the question: As the decade wraps up, who has been the best Major League Third Baseman in the previous 10 years? Many baseball fans have a strong opinion on this question, and opening with it will hopefully peaks the audience's interest. I will then have a short section defining relevant terms to help the non-baseball people understand what is happening. 

Within the defenseive category, I will talk about the statitics that I used, why I picked them, and how they reinforce a player's talent. I will have charts for each of my 3 statistics with only the top 2 highlighted. At the end, I will show the charts for the defensive awards to help reinforce the idea that other people in the baseball world have similar views. 

In the offensive category, I will repeat the formula from the defensive category by going over why those statistics and how they tell the story. Again, I will wrap up with a discussion of the awards. 

Bringing it all together, I will talk about the top 3 defensive players and top 3 offensive players to come up with our eventual Third Baseman of the Decade. The strongest candidates will also be the most complete. I hope that this presentation will spark conversation and get people excited about the future of baseball. 

The user journey will largely depend on which team they support. Some of the fan favorites at Third Base aren't even going to be included in this discussion because they did not qualify the required 5 years (looking at you, Kris Bryant). Hopefully the average baseball fan will have an overall pleasant journey through the data and learn more about some of the current players at the hot corner. 

### Data 

I pulled my data in from a variety of sources. For hitting and fielding data, I went straight to the [statistics page](http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp?c_id=mlb#elem=%5Bobject+Object%5D&tab_level=child&click_text=Sortable+Player+hitting&game_type='R'&season=2019&season_type=ANY&league_code='MLB'&sectionType=sp&statType=hitting&page=1&ts=1569466642560) on [MLB.com](https://www.mlb.com). There I sorted by position (3B) for each year and collated the data in an Excel spreadsheet. Major League Baseball does a good job of tracking the hitting and fielding statistics of their players in real time, and it is easy to sort and find what I needed for this project. 

For the awards, I pulled from both [Baseball Almanac](https://www.baseball-almanac.com) and [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/). These two sites both presented the award information in a format that was easier to read and formulate for data visualizations. That was important since I am spending so much time with the hitting and fielding data. 
Baseball Almanac: [Platinum Glove Award](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/Platinum_Glove_Award.shtml); [Gold Glove Award](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_gg3b.shtml)
Baseball Reference: [Wilson Defensive Player of the Year](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/wilson_def_player.shtml); [Hank Aaron Award](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hank_rickey.shtml); [Silver Slugger Award](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/silver_slugger_al.shtml)

### Sketches

When I started sketching for this project, I tried to think of what visualization would be the best for which statistic. I started with defensive statistics and worked my way from the big picture (Fielding Percentage) to the more specific details (Total Chances and Range). I included a discussion of the awards at the bottom. I wasn't sure if I was going to show the awards in a table or visualization form. When talking with a classmate who does not know baseball, I was told that she would prefer a visualization for the awards as well as the statitics. That conversation also reinforced the need for a section explaining what the statistics mean. I am hoping that I can incorporate that seemlessly instead of making it hard to understand what is going on. I started reimagining what the graphs might look like on the second page, where they are completely out of order. 

Then I moved on to offensive statistics. Here, I went with a more historical approach. Traditionally, the Home Run, Runs Batted In, and Average have all been looked at together. Having the highest in all three categories is known as the Triple Crown and is very rare in modern day baseball. The advent of computers to run statistics for us has made the number of bizarre sports statistics climb astronomically. I chose OPS, which is On-base Plus Slugging, because it is ["widely considered one of the best evaluative tools for hitters."](http://m.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/on-base-plus-slugging) While no one statistic can tell the complete story, these four offensive lines will make a good case when used together. Then, like before, I will wrap up the section by looking at the awards to help solidify my point. The inclusion of the awards is important because it references people besides me who share a similar thought on the Third Baseman of the Decade.

### Method for Presentation

I plan to use Shorthand to present this project. I think that the tools there will best suit my story design and my technological capabilites. I think it will be fun to learn how to use that platform to create a website and import datavisualizations. I also am hoping that I can create sections that lend themselves to a logical flow for this presentaion. I think that I can create a site that tells the story effectively and that will be usful in presenting my final project to class. 

I also plan to use the data visualization tools that we have discussed in class. I will do some of the work in Raw Graphs, but I would like to make at least one data visualization in Tableau to get more comfortable with that as a tool 

## Part II

### Wireframe

The first wireframe was made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com), and lays out how everything will be presented in the final Shorthand version. The following hand drawn wireframes are for each of the data visualizations that will be included in the wireframe. They go in order of how they are laid out in the Balsamiq wireframe. These drawings are designed to show all of the pertinent information in the data visualization so that I can get feedback from my peers.

### Personas

The following personas were designed to represent three different type of people who might view this presentation. People will come to this with varying knowledge and opinions on baseball and third basemen in the game. Each of these three people has a different current involvement with the game. (Click pictures for sources)

This is Grace.

[![Girl with baseball and bat](https://rmkingham.github.io/Kingham.TSWD/images/Grace.jpg)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/291467407127890428/?lp=true)

Grace is a 13 year old girl from Manhattan, Kansas. She lives with her dad and her pet frog. She is a tomboy and loves to get dirty whenever possible. Grace loves baseball and has been following it closely for the last 5 years. She plays third base for her town little league town and loves to watch defensive highlights. Grace is always ready with a statistic or fact to prove her point when talking about the game.

This is Steven.

[![Boy holding his lunch](https://rmkingham.github.io/Kingham.TSWD/images/Steven.png)](https://www.sccpre.cat/show/ixhoJ_boy-lunch-png-clip-art-pinterest-lunches-/)

Steven is 15 and lives in Atlanta, Georgia. Steven really likes art and doesn't know much about sports. He wants to care because all of his friends talk about baseball all the time, but he would rather spend his time drawing than watching a game. He also likes numbers because they make sense even when people don't. 

This is Adam.

[![Man standing](https://rmkingham.github.io/Kingham.TSWD/images/Adam.png)](https://www.1001freedownloads.com/free-clipart/daddy-standing-01)

Adam is a farmer in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. He used to pitch for his high school baseball team years ago with home town hero turned Major Leaguer Mike Mussina. Adam followed Mike's career but has stopped paying attention since Mike retired in 2008. Adam occassionally watches the World Series if he remembers that it's on. He has no idea who the current stars.

### Storyboard
Reading this project will be different for the different personas. Each of the three people have different interests and investments in the game of baseball. The following storyboards detail the journey's of Grace, Steven, and Adam.

### Moodboard
This presentation's theme will be centered around baseball equipment and the field. There will hopefully be pictures of the players, but I need to make sure that I'm allowed to use them!

### Research Protocol
My target audience is baseball fans. I think that fans of all levels will be interested in a concise presentation of the statistics in an easily accessible manner. Too often, statisticians make things much more complicate than they need to be, so this will hopefully be easier for the casual baseball fan to understand.

When doing user research, I wanted to make sure that I had a variety of perspectives. I spoke with three people: one who is a baseball fan, one who follows baseball but not that closely, and one who doesn't know anything about the intricacies of the game. In each of the conversations, I asked the following questions.
 - What do you think each visualization is telling you?
 - What confused you about each visualization?
 - Do you have any suggestions on what I could do better?

### Findings

The first person that I talked to was not a baseball fan. She said that she liked the visualizations for the fielding percentage, batting average, home run, and runs batted in and could easily understand what they were saying in their current form. The total chances, range, and OPS were more confusing, partly because the statistics are a little bit more off the wall. I need to make sure that I can define them in a way that the visualization makes sense. She did suggest making the points different shapes for the different players, which will help once everyone is on the graph. The other comment she made was that having 11 different players to look at seemed like a lot for the scope of this assignment. 

The second person that I talked to is an avid casual fan. She likes to watch games but does not delve deep into the metrics behind the game. She thought that most of the confusion would come from terminology because she didn't know some of the statistics either. She also said that the tables for the awards confused her. I will need to look at how I can provide that same information differently. 

My third friend enjoys watching baseball but doesn't really follow it. She thought it was odd that some players start in the middle of my time window. I need to make sure that I address their playing years up front to clear up this confusion. She also said that I need make my titles more descriptive. She was confused by the time frame over which this is all happening, but I think that will be more clear in the final presentation because of the introduction. She suggested that I address how many games each of these players plays in per year. Her final comment was to turn the OPS bar chart so that it is horizontal instead of vertical. I think I will try this and try to narrow the OPS number down to just one to describe the entire decade. 

### Updated Wireframe and Storyboard

From the feedback that I received, I have decided to reduce the number of people that I am looking at. I was debating whether the players that I'm analyzing needed to be MLB qualifiers for 5 or 6 years anyway and increasing the number to 6 years drops the number of players to be analyzed from 11 to 6. I think this will help in overall understanding of the story without truly degrading from its integrity. In an actual sports analysis, I would want to look at all players regardless of time served, but that is impractical for the scope of this assignment. 

I also will add shapes to my line graphs. I think that associating a player with a certain shape will help make the graphs more readible since no one player is really more important than the others and thus color highlighting isn't as useful. I will still highlight my ultimate top 3 in the final visualizations to help give structure to my story. 

I need to address the issue of playing years for each of my 6 players. I need to make it clear which years' data is being used for this project and how it was narrowed down. I want to be sure that the years where they were injured/new don't hurt their averages but are still represented in the data. 

Finally, I need to show the awards data differently. In my sketching feedback, I was told that the tables weren't super helpful, but I couldn't figure out how to make a chart that showed all the pertinent information. Now, I will try reorganizing the table so that it is grouped by player and not by year. This will allow me to highlight only the 6 players that I'm focusing on instead of everyone who has won an award at third base in the last 10 years. 

### Call to Action

During the discussion in class, I solidified the call to action. I will call for people to join the conversation online with their opinions using the hashtag #3Bdebate.
