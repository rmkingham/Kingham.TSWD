# Final Project: Third Baseman of the Decade (2010-2019)

## Outline

In this project, I will analyze data from Major League Third Basemen over the last 10 years to determine who has been the most effective. In order to be considered, each Third Baseman will have had to qualify for year end awards (by MLB standards) for at least 5 of the 10 years. 

The major elements of my story will be the defensive analysis, offensive analysis, awards discussion, and conclusion. To assess defense, I will look at Fielding Percentage, Average Total Chances over their qualifying years, and Range Factor. To assess offense, I will look at Batting Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, and Onbase Percentage plus Slugging. This selection should satisfy both the traditionalists and the modernists by included the statistics for the Triple Crown and the modern OPS. In addition to that, I will use the data from the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year, Rawlings Gold and Platinum Gloves, Hank Aaron, and Silver Slugger awards to strengthen my case. 

I plan to start with the question: As the decade wraps up, who has been the best Major League Third Baseman in the previous 10 years? Many baseball fans have a strong opinion on this question, and opening with it will hopefully peaks the audience's interest. I will then have a short section defining relevant terms to help the non-baseball people understand what is happening. 

Within the defenseive category, I will talk about the statitics that I used, why I picked them, and how they reinforce a player's talent. I will have charts for each of my 3 statistics with only the top 2 highlighted. At the end, I will show the charts for the defensive awards to help reinforce the idea that other people in the baseball world have similar views. 

In the offensive category, I will repeat the formula from the defensive category by going over why those statistics and how they tell the story. Again, I will wrap up with a discussion of the awards. 

Bringing it all together, I will talk about the top 3 defensive players and top 3 offensive players to come up with our eventual Third Baseman of the Decade. The strongest candidates will also be the most complete. I hope that this presentation will spark conversation and get people excited about the future of baseball. 

The user journey will largely depend on which team they support. Some of the fan favorites at Third Base aren't even going to be included in this discussion because they did not qualify the required 5 years (looking at you, Kris Bryant). Hopefully the average baseball fan will have an overall pleasant journey through the data and learn more about some of the current players at the hot corner. 

## Data 

I pulled my data in from a variety of sources. For hitting and fielding data, I went straight to the [statistics page](http://mlb.mlb.com/stats/sortable.jsp?c_id=mlb#elem=%5Bobject+Object%5D&tab_level=child&click_text=Sortable+Player+hitting&game_type='R'&season=2019&season_type=ANY&league_code='MLB'&sectionType=sp&statType=hitting&page=1&ts=1569466642560) on [MLB.com](mlb.com). There I sorted by position (3B) for each year and collated the data in an Excel spreadsheet. Major League Baseball does a good job of tracking the hitting and fielding statistics of their players in real time, and it is easy to sort and find what I needed for this project. 

For the awards, I pulled from both [Baseball Almanac](https://www.baseball-almanac.com) and [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/). These two sites both presented the award information in a format that was easier to read and formulate for data visualizations. That was important since I am spending so much time with the hitting and fielding data. 
Baseball Almanac: [Platinum Glove Award](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/Platinum_Glove_Award.shtml); [Gold Glove Award](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/aw_gg3b.shtml)
Baseball Reference: [Wilson Defensive Player of the Year](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/wilson_def_player.shtml); [Hank Aaron Award](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hank_rickey.shtml); [Silver Slugger Award](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/silver_slugger_al.shtml)

I am still in the process of cleaning the data to reduce it down to only what I need, but the large Excel document with all of it can be found [here](https://rmkingham.github.io/Kingham.TSWD/MLB 3B Data.xlsx). 

## Sketches

We've explored how sketching can be a great way to help solidify your ideas into design choices, and for your proposal you'll be creating sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project.  You may choose to present your sketches and integrate them into Part I of your final project in whatever fashion you feel makes the most sense - but they should be clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background for your project.  Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate and you may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.).

## Method for Presentation

I plan to use Shorthand to present this project. I think that the tools there will best suit my story design and my technological capabilites. I think it will be fun to learn how to use that platform to create a website and import datavisualizations. I also am hoping that I can create sections that lend themselves to a logical flow for this presentaion. I think that I can create a site that tells the story effectively and that will be usful in presenting my final project to class. 

I also plan to use the data visualization tools that we have discussed in class. I will do some of the work in Raw Graphs, but I would like to make at least one data visualization in Tableau to get more comfortable with that as a tool
